(Note: This program is not currently connecting to the Database or the API, due to the Web App and Database being deleted when the Student Azure subscription expired. All code still remains the same and is still in working order.)

This challenge comprised of the following steps:
- Creating a MySQL database, filling it with sample data and deploying to Azure with a Post Deployment Script.
- Creating a RESTful Web API using Entity Framework and publishing it to an Azure Web App.
- Creating a C# WPF Application that does the following:
    - The list of Procedures for each Pet in the system.
    - The list of Treatments for each Pet in the system.
    - The ability to Create, Update, and Delete Pets and Owners.
- Input validation implemented using Regex.
- Logging implemented using NLog.
